                        <p class="mb-30">
                            In Nigeria, after over three (3) decades since the attainment of our national independence,
                            some concerned new generation practitioners in facility management got together in Lagos 
                            in 1995 and founded IFMA of Nigeria. The group of facility management professionals came 
                            together to initiate and establish a Nigeria Chapter of the International Facility Management 
                            Association, IFMA, it was first and foremost born out of the desire to provide Nigeria with 
                            the opportunity of developing a maintenance culture that will shape the future of the country.
